This page is tested using basic testing techniques and applying them to the state management solution of
<a href="https://ngrx.io/" target="_blank">NgRx</a>. NgRx offers <a href="https://ngrx.io/guide/store/testing" target="_blank">Testing support</a> for
example over the provideMockStore() function. We will use what was provided, to make testing as efficient as possible. Feel free to play with it a
little and inspect the code for showcases on how it is tested.
